Given the following screen data which is in json format :
                                    {screen_data}.
                                    And the following task prompt:
                                    {task_prompt}.

                                    ** Understand the all the fields of screen data clearly.
                                    ** Determine if the task can be executed based on the screen's current state.

                                    ### **Validation Criteria:**
                                    - Identify the fields required to execute the task from the given task prompt.
                                    - Use **semantic matching** to recognize variations in wording for actions and fields required for action(e.g., "Type Y and Enter" ≈ "Press Y and hit Enter" ≈ "Input Y and confirm").
                                    - Assume that an **input field is always present** unless the screen explicitly states otherwise.
                                    - If the task requires **pressing a key (e.g., 'Enter')**, assume the system supports this action unless explicitly restricted.
                                    - If **all** required fields are present in the screen data (or functionally equivalent), return `true`.
                                    - If **any** required field is **explicitly missing**, return `false`.
                                    ### **Important Notes:**
                                    - If an action like "Type or Enter" is required, assume that an **input box exists** and can accept the key press.
                                    - **Do not be overly strict** with wording—if functionally equivalent elements exist, they should be considered a match.
                                    --**return summary in few words
                                    - **Strictly return only `true` if tasks mentioned in the prompt are matching the screen data else return `false` dont return any explanations.
